/**
 * The frame every inner page renders inside: header, the page's own
 * sections, footer.
 *
 * It also owns the two behaviours that have to be page-wide rather than
 * per-section:
 *
 *   - the homepage's word-by-word heading blur-in, re-armed on every
 *     navigation so a second page's headings animate like the first's,
 *   - scroll reset on navigation. React Router leaves the scroll position
 *     alone, and Lenis holds its own position independent of the DOM, so
 *     without this a click from the bottom of one page lands halfway down
 *     the next.
 *
 * `title` sets document.title. Pages pass the bare page name; the suffix
 * is added here so it stays consistent.

        `key={pathname}` forces a fresh subtree on every navigation, and it
        is load-bearing rather than defensive.

        The blur-in works by wrapping each heading word in a span — it
        mutates DOM that React owns — and its cleanup puts the original
        markup back. Where a navigation swaps one page component for
        another that is harmless, because the old nodes are discarded. But
        three of these routes are parameterised (`/industries/:slug`,
        `/products/:slug`, `/insights/:slug`), and moving between two of
        their params keeps the same component mounted, so React reuses the
        very <h1> the cleanup is about to overwrite. Automotive's headline
        appeared on the Industrial page exactly this way.

        Keying on the path makes the parameterised routes behave like every
        other navigation: old tree out, new nodes in, nothing to clobber.

        The ref sits on <main> rather than the outer div so the wrap only
        covers page content — the footer's column headings are <h2>s too,
        and they neither need the effect nor should replay it on each
        navigation.
