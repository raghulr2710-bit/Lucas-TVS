        // sectors was 270vh of scrolling to clear the block, 55 took it to
        // 165vh, 37 to ~111vh, and 30 brings it to ~90vh.
        //
        // The later steps are not further speed-ups: `rotationTurns` came

        // length comes off to match, holding the pace at ~45vh per sector.

        //
        // At the default of 1, the pinned range covers a FULL revolution, so
        // the sequence ran Defence -> Automotive -> Industrial -> Defence:
        // the closing stretch rotated back to the frame the section opened
        // on, spending real scroll to show something already seen.
        //
        // Cutting straight to 2/3 fixed that but broke Defence. It put
        // Defence's focus at exactly progress 0, so it was only ever the
        // section's arrival state — the first scroll input rotated it away
        // and it never held. Effectively it stopped appearing at all.
        //
        // A sector is at full focus when its position on the circle reaches
        // localProgress 0.75 (that is where `sin(angle + leftAngleOffset)`
        // peaks, with the default `leftAngleOffset` of PI). Working back
        // from that, `focusPhase` 0.25 puts the three foci exactly a third
        // of a turn apart starting at zero:
        //
        //   spin 0    Defence & Aerospace
        //   spin 1/3  Automotive
        //   spin 2/3  Industrial
        //
        // So `rotationTurns` is 2/3 — the last focus, and no further. The
        // rotation ENDS on Industrial at full focus and the pin releases on
        // that frame.
        //
        // Both halves of this matter, and each was got wrong once. At
        // `focusPhase` 0 the foci sit at 11/12, 1/4 and 7/12, which puts
        // Defence a twelfth of a turn PAST focus at the start — already
        // fading before the section pins, so it never held and read as
        // missing. And at `rotationTurns` 3/4 the pin ran a twelfth of a
        // turn PAST Industrial, so the section's parting frame was a
        // half-faded card (opacity 0.78) rather than the sector itself.
