/**
 * Home3-only replacement for `Careers`, built to the client's 22 Sep
 * reference.
 *
 * The parent is a full-bleed campus photo with a black scrim and centred
 * white copy over it. This is the same words over a different photograph:
 * the engineer-and-HUD scene, with the copy sitting in the blurred lab
 * space on its left. Nothing about the message changed — the review kept
 * this section as it was, and only the treatment is new.
 *
 * It also drops the last plant photography on the page. The parent's
 * backdrop is the Lucas-TVS campus, which the 16 Sep review ruled out
 * everywhere; the new scene is an engineer at work instead.
 *
 * `careersBackdrop` stays exactly as it is for Home, NewHome and Home2.

          without it the only thing defining the section's edge is where the
          photograph happens to end. `inset-0` on the image resolves to the
          padding box, so the photograph sits inside the border rather than

          The scene is the section's background, not a panel beside the
          copy. The supplied photograph is 2000x782 and already carries a
          wide stretch of softly blurred lab on its left — the reference is
          this same frame with the copy sitting in exactly that space.

          Below `lg` it cannot work that way: a 2.56 ratio band with text
          over it leaves the copy nowhere to go, so there the image is an
          ordinary banner and the copy runs underneath it. From `lg` it goes
          absolute and fills the panel.

          `object-[68%_center]` holds the engineer and her display in frame
          as the panel gets narrower, rather than centring on empty bench.
